1.0 Introduction

Data Crow is an application to register Software, Images, Music Files, Audio CDs, 
Books and Movies. The registration is automated as far as possible. To achieve 
this, an internet connection is needed as Data Crow uses web services 
to retrieve information about a piece of software, an audio CD or a movie. Further more, 
files are parsed to retrieve useful information. 

Features:

* A great help system (F1) - linked to the various screens and functions in Data Crow but
  also accessible from here: https://datacrow.org/docs
* Skinnable, nice looking and easy to use UI.
* You can customize almost everything; design your own item form, quick view, hide fields
  and module which you are not using and create your own reports (XSLT scripts).  
* Platform independent and completely portable (run from an USB stick).
* Loan administration. Keep track of your loans.
* Web and Application Server (separate download).
* Create your own collection modules and/or modify existing collection modules.
* Advanced user configuration (access rights + module and field access).
* Rename your files based on the information of Data Crow.
* Highly customizable; add your own fields, alter existing modules or create a new
  one, rename any text within the application, set the fonts, ..
* Reporting (PDF, HTML, Text and XML).
* Registration of Software, Audio CDs and Music Files, Books, Movies and Images.
* Search for items using online services.
* Extract information from files on your CD, DVD or hard disk:
  image files (JPG, GIF, PNG, SVG), music files (technical info and tag content of 
  ASF, OGG, APE, FLAC and MP3 files) and movie file (MP4, DivX, Xvid, ASF, MKV, OGM, 
  RIFF, MOV, IFO, VOB and Mpeg video).
* Internal HSQL database + SQL query tool for expert users.

Data Crow does not write information to the registry or any other platform specific 
folder or structure. All the information is kept within the Data Crow installation 
folder. It does not obey platform specific rules and can run on any platform 
(Windows, Linux and others) having Java Second Edition version 11 (from Oracle or 
OpenJDK) or higher installed. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 Requirements

Data Crow needs Java;
Java Second Edition 11 (or higher) from Oracle (https://java.com/)
  
Data Crow was tested on:
Windows 11 and Ubuntu (latest version at the moment of testing).
Systems used: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz / 8GB of RAM

Minimum requirement: 
An 1.0 Ghz system is perfectly capable of running Data Crow.
Data Crow needs, for large collections, at least 256 MB of free memory.
(a collection of 10,000 items or more is considered large).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0 About the database (HSQL)

Data Crow uses the HSQL database engine. It's powerful, fast and can run on
any system. Look at https://hsqldb.org for more information

By default a database with the name "dc" is used. You can use a different database by 
using the parameters. See chapter 6.0 for more information.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.0 Upgrading

1) Create a backup of your data in the old version using the Backup & Restore utility
2) Install the new version on top of the existing version.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.0 Building the project

Use Maven to build this project. From the root folder (Modules/) type mvn clean install
and all the modules will be build. To create the various installers and zip files run
mvn clean package from the Modules/datacrow-install folder. Note that for the latter
you do require a valid certificate in order to sign the executables for Windows.
These are naturally not provided with this library as they are essential to the 
integrity of the official software packages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.0 Starting Data Crow

The installer will create shortcuts for your convenience. Alternatively, Data Crow can 
be started by typing "java -jar datacrow-client-<version>.jar". 

If you use multiple Data Crow installations you have several choices to make:

    -Use the Server version of Data Crow. Run this on one machine and connect to from 
     your other devices & machines. This is the best option.

    -Set up a user folder on a network share. Each of the Data Crow installations will
     point to this user folder. This is established by selecting the same user folder  
     on each of the Data Crow installations.

    -In case you run multiple Data Crow instances on one machine you can either have  
     them using the same user directory (sharing the same settings and data) or assign a 
     separate user folder to each of the installations (-userdir parameter).. 

    -In addition to the above you can share the user folder between the various 
     installations but have them using a different database per installation 
     (-db parameter).

The various parameters you can use are listed below:
    
    -client
     This has to be used in case you want to connect to a client.
    
    -db:<database name> 
     Forces Data Crow to use another database.
    
    -dir:<installation directory> 
     Use this parameter when Data Crow starts incorrectly and complains about missing 
     directories (non Windows platform only). 
     
    -userdir:<user directory> 
     Use this parameter to specify a specific user directory. Multiple instances
     of Data Crow can be started using this parameter. Additionally the selected user
     folder path will not be stored in the datacrow.properties file. You can also make
     the path relative to the Data Crow installation folder by supplying the path as
     './<folder name>'. Example: -userdir:./data
    
    -credentials:username/password
     Specify the login credentials to start Data Crow without displaying the login dialog.
     
    -debug
     For additional logging information.

7.0 Credits

This application would not have succeeded (or even existed) without the help of:

* Ariel Chyłek for his persistence and assistance of users. Even when Data Crow was as
  good as abandoned he hang in there and advised and helped the users of Data Crow.
  Oh, and also the Polish language is always up to date because of this legend;
  hats of to you sir! 
* Ingo / iro-de for supplying the German translation, helping out with testing and 
  making recommendations to improve the product.
* Flag-Courier (sourceforge.net user) and Tostis (also a sourceforge.net user)
  for updating the build process and maintaining the code when Data Crow was abandoned.
* https://sourceforge.net for hosting Data Crow.
* The creators of the many, many 3rd party libraries use by Data Crow, such as:
  Apache Tika, HSQL DB, Jetty, JTattoo, jAudiotagger, Liferay MP4Parser, Bouncy Castle,
  Jacksum, jSoup, Gson (Google), Jasper Reports, ImageIO (Twelve Monkeys), Apache Batik, 
  Apache Log4j2.
* izPack for providing a smooth way to install Data Crow on multiple platforms.
